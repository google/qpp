For example, you can ask for an object properties 'last change'. \r\nThe Querypoint debugger will give you the source code location where the property was\r\nlast modified and its value there. \r\n\r\n### qpp is part of a Querypoint Debugger\r\n\r\nThis project defines a Querypoint debugger extension for the Chrome devtools. A downloadable integrated Chrome extension is available at https://code.google.com/p/querypoint-debugger/. \r\n\r\nCurrently this Querypoint Debugger can only debug one demo project. The instructions are here: http://google.github.com/qpp/test/LayoutTests/DocGen/demoSetup.html\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe concept of Querypoint debugging was invented by Salman Mirghasemi as part of his PhD at EPFL. His thesis is available: http://dx.doi.org/10.5075/epfl-thesis-5533. Contributors to the qpp project include\r\n@johnjbarton and @curcio. "}
